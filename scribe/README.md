# ✨ Scribe Plugin

> Document writing workflow for [Claude Cowork](https://claude.com/product/cowork) and [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/).

Draft outlines, write documents in parallel by section, output in any format.

## Installation

### Local Testing

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./scribe
```

### From Marketplace

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add SnowLightPath/snow-light-place
claude plugin install scribe@snow-light-place
```

### Project Setup

After installing, copy the CLAUDE.md template to your project:

```bash
cp scribe/CLAUDE.md .claude/CLAUDE.md
```

Edit `.claude/CLAUDE.md` to set your project name and customize detection targets.

## The Loop

```
  /scribe:draft          Design the outline
       ↓
  scribe.md         ←→   Document structure
       ↓
  /scribe:realize        Write & export
       ↓
  report.docx       ←→   Human & LLM edit
       ↓
  /scribe:reflect        Review & improve
       ↓
  (iterate)
```

## Commands

| Command | Intent | Example |
|---------|--------|---------|
| `/scribe:draft` | Design document outline, audience, format | `/scribe:draft quarterly report` |
| `/scribe:realize` | Write and export the document | `/scribe:realize report.docx` |
| `/scribe:reflect` | Review quality and improve | `/scribe:reflect report.docx` |

## Supported Formats

| Format | Extension | Tool Chain | Official Skill |
|--------|-----------|------------|----------------|
| Markdown | `.md` | Direct write | — |
| PDF | `.pdf` | Python + reportlab | [`pdf`](https://github.com/anthropics/skills/tree/main/skills/pdf) |
| Word | `.docx` | JS + docx-js | [`docx`](https://github.com/anthropics/skills/tree/main/skills/docx) |
| HTML | `.html` | Python + markdown | — |
| Excel | `.xlsx` | Python + openpyxl | [`xlsx`](https://github.com/anthropics/skills/tree/main/skills/xlsx) |
| PowerPoint | `.pptx` | JS + pptxgenjs | [`pptx`](https://github.com/anthropics/skills/tree/main/skills/pptx) |
| Pencil Design | `.pen` | Pencil MCP | — |
| Confluence | `--confluence` | Atlassian MCP | — |

## How It Works

### 1. Draft the outline

```bash
/scribe:draft
> "Write a quarterly report. Sales analysis, project progress, next steps."
```

Creates `scribe.md` — a document design file:

```markdown
# Q4 Quarterly Report

## Meta
- format: docx
- audience: executive
- tone: formal
- language: ja

## Outline
### 1. Sales Analysis
### 2. Project Progress
### 3. Next Steps

## Sources
- data/sales_q4.csv
```

### 2. Write the document

```bash
/scribe:realize quarterly-report.docx
```

Scribe reads `scribe.md` and writes sections **in parallel** using SWARM:

```
writer-1: §1 Sales Analysis    ─→ ┐
writer-2: §2 Project Progress  ─→ ├─→ Lead merges → docx-js → DOCX
writer-3: §3 Next Steps        ─→ ┘
```

### 3. Review and improve

```bash
/scribe:reflect quarterly-report.docx
```

Reviews quality, consistency, and completeness. Suggests improvements.

## Parallel Writing

Documents with 2+ sections are written in parallel. Each writer agent receives:
- The section outline
- Meta settings (tone, audience, language)
- Relevant source material
- Cross-reference context

The lead agent merges sections, unifies tone, resolves cross-references, and converts to the target format.

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Required For | Install |
|------|-------------|---------|
| reportlab | PDF output | `pip3 install reportlab` |
| docx (npm) | DOCX output | `npm install -g docx` |
| pptxgenjs (npm) | PPTX output | `npm install -g pptxgenjs` |
| openpyxl | XLSX output | `pip3 install openpyxl` |
| markdown | HTML output | `pip3 install markdown` |
| Pencil MCP | .pen output | Configure in MCP settings |
| Atlassian MCP | Confluence | Configure in MCP settings |

Only install what you need. The plugin checks dependencies at runtime and prompts for missing tools.

### Recommended: Official Anthropic Skills

For the best output quality, install the official [document skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anthropics/skills.git ~/.claude/skills-repo
for skill in pdf docx pptx xlsx doc-coauthoring; do
  ln -sf ~/.claude/skills-repo/skills/$skill ~/.claude/skills/$skill
done
```

When installed, Scribe automatically uses these skills for format conversion instead of its built-in fallback pipelines.

## Philosophy

> Write the structure before the sentences. Divide to conquer. Merge to polish.
